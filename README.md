### What should you know about me?

#### :computer: Software Development
I have been working with development and coding for about 4 years, precisely with mobile development. I can work with both frontend and backend. I have to say that my favorite stack is:

**React Native, TypeScript/ES6, GraphQL and Node.js**

But I believe that we can't let programming languages or frameworks interfere with our passion to code thus I am able to work with all technologies if it is needed. We may never forget that programming languages are tools to solve problems. Let's solve them with the best tool available.

#### :art: UI/UX Lover

I have worked on the entire product development cycle, from requirements gathering to the deployment phase. But projecting best solution for the users has a special place in my heart and I'm always having fun when projecting cute and assertive screens. I'm super familiar with:

**Material Design, Figma and UI/UX principles**

#### :two_women_holding_hands: Community Raiser

I carry the mantra that everything we learn, if it is relevant to others, we must share. Knowledge is precious, we must share it. Therefore, I seek to create content to share with our tech community through technical articles, lectures and sharing little personal experiences online. You can check my personal sharings on:

**Medium, DEV and Twitter**
