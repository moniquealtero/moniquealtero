### What you should know about me?

#### :computer: Software Development
I have been working with development and coding for about 3 years, precisely with mobile development. I can work with both frontend and backend. 
I love to work with: **React Native, TypeScript/ES6, GraphQL and Node JS.**

#### :art: UI/UX Lover

I have worked on the entire product development cycle, from requirements gathering to the deployment phase. But projecting best solution for the users has a special place in my heart. I’m super familiar to: **Material Design, Figma and UI/UX principles.**

#### :two_women_holding_hands: Community Raiser

I carry the philosophy of living that everything we learn, if it is relevant to others, we must share. Therefore, I seek to create content to share with our tech community through technical articles, lectures, personal experiences or courses.
